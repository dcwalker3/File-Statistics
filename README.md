# File Statistics
This project was made as a way to improve my skill 
with handling files inside of C++. This program
will ask for a file path and then will analyze some basic
information about the file.

Example:

    File Name/Location: C:\Users\dakot\Documents\Object Oriented Paradigm\File Statistics\input.txt
    File Extension: .txt
    File Size: 3KB
    Word Count: 626
    Line Count: 19
    Most common word: 'in' with frequency: 8
    Least common word: 'Advice' with frequency: 1
